# Rock Paper Scissors (Proof of Concept)

This is a small **Rock Paper Scissors** game built in JavaScript as part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/).  
It runs in the browser console and demonstrates basic JavaScript concepts like functions, conditionals, loops, and user input with `prompt()`.

1. Open the project in your browser.
2. Open the developer console (Right click → **Inspect** → **Console**).
3. Run the script.
4. Enter your choice when prompted (`rock`, `paper`, or `scissors`).
5. The computer will randomly choose its move.
6. Scores are tracked for both human and computer.
